Raster images (pixel by pixel) can be converted to vector images (shapes + curves) with free online tools.
Most work by picking a discrete number of colours, then fitting bounding boxes around blobs of the same colour.
I tried these out, but had trouble hiding the blobs.

Others (which I haven't tried yet) claim to find simple shapes and curves. I feel like this has some promise at 'hiding' the target image. A complexity is in how to handle the layering, it relies on blobs on higher layers covering up lower layers, but I can't cover it up when everything is transparent in this project.
